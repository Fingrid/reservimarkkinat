# Business Context
**Fast Frequency Reserve** or FFR is an automatic reserve product that is procured to manage situations with low inertia in the power system, and to prevent the frequency of the power system from falling below 49,0 Hz should a power generation unit or HVDC link be lost. Inertia refers to the ability of the power grid to resist changes in frequency. FFR is procured daily from a national hourly market. The need for FFR procurement is determined by the inertia of the hour. FFR was introduced in the Nordic power system in May 2020.
