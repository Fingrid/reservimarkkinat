# Business Context
Frequency Containment Reserves (FCR) are automatically activated based on changes in the power system frequency. The Frequency Containment Reserve for Normal operation (FCR-N) aims to maintain the frequency within the normal range of 49.9–50.1 Hz. The Frequency Containment Reserve for Disturbances (FCR-D), on the other hand, aims to keep the frequency between 49.5–50.5 Hz when the frequency deviates from the normal range.

FCR-N is a symmetrical product, where the reserve unit must be capable of both upward and downward regulation. FCR-D is divided into separate upward and downward regulation products, FCR-D Up and FCR-D Down.
