## Development roadmap
New documentation content is continuously added to the portal on all reserve markets. There will also be a testing section where the market participants are able to test their market data exchange. We will introduce bid submission for aFRR energy markets to the testing portal during 2025. We will adjust the documentation as well as other features based on the feedback we receive.
