# Business Context
## Overall process overview
Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) is a reserve whose purpose is to restore the power grid's frequency to its nominal value of 50 Hz. aFRR activates automatically based on an activation signal sent by the TSO, and demand is based on the frequency deviation of the Nordic area as well as the results of the aFRR Capacity Market. the aFRR energy market started operating in Finland in June 2024, and Fingrid will join the European PICASSO platform in March 2025.

BSPs send aFRR energy bids to the Vaksi platform between gate opening and closure times. BSPs are also responsible for activating their bids according to the automatic activation signal received. Energy bids are selected for activation according to the Automatic Optimization Function (AOF), which selects optimal bids out of the common bid lists sent by the TSOs to the PICASSO platform. Transparency data is published on the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform as well as the TSOs' own websites after the validity period ends.
