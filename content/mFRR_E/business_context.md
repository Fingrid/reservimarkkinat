# Business Context
mFRR (Manual Frequency Restoration Reserve) is a type of reserve whose purpose is to restore the grid's frequency to its nominal value of 50 Hz. mFRR energy bids are activated after receiving an activation message from the TSO. mFRR energy bids are selected for activation according to the Activation Optimization Function (AOF), which selects optimal bids out of the common bid lists sent by the TSOs. 

Since the implementation of the Nordic automated mFRR energy activation market (EAM) on 4th of March 2025, the market time unit (MTU) for mFRR energy bids has been 15 minutes. BSPs can send mFRR energy bids to the Vaksi platform until 45 minutes before the quarter-hour, and activation messages are sent 7.5 minutes before the quarter-hour. 

### MARI
MARI is a common European platform for mFRR energy bids. The Nordic mFRR EAM is an important stepping stone for the eventual accession to MARI.
