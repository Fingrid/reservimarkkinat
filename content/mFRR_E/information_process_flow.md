# Information Process Flow

This page describes the information process flow between BSPs, Fingrid, the Nordic common merit order list (CMOL), and others.

From the BSP's perspective, information process flow consists of the following:
* Sending bids and receiving acknowledgements
* Receiving activation order messages and sending responses to the orders
* Receiving bid availability reports and activation reports
Additionally, BSPs can receive market results from transparency platforms and activation settlement results from eSett, which will not be covered in detail in this wiki.
