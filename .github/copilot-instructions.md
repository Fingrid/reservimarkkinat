## Project context
The project is designed to be a developer portal for Fingrid parters
containing information about Fingrid's services and providing tools for
developers to validate their applications and test their integrations with Fingrid's APIs.

## Tecnologies
This is a frontend project, built upon Nextra (Next.JS). 
The technology stack includes React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The package manager used is pnpm, and the project is set up with ESLint and 
Prettier for code quality and formatting.

## Coding style
Use camelCase for variable names and prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions.
Prefer immutability and functional programming paradigms where possible.
Use async/await for asynchronous code and handle errors gracefully.
Use descriptive variable and function names to enhance code readability.
Avoid extensive use of comments; instead, write self-explanatory code.

## Testing
We use Vitest for unit testing.
